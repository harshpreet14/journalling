# Journaling App
I have witnessed the struggles of friends, family, and even myself when it comes to mental health. Many of us have turned to therapy, and one preliminary method that most therapists recommend is  journaling. However, traditional journaling has its limitations, which became apparent to me and those close to me.
The first challenge we encountered with traditional journaling is the difficulty of capturing our thoughts and emotions in real-time. The speed at which our minds generate thoughts surpasses our ability to write them down. It's frustrating when we can't fully express ourselves and capture the essence of our experiences.
Secondly, traditional journaling often requires dedicated time set aside for writing, which means important triggers and emotions experienced throughout the day may be missed or forgotten.
That's why I was inspired to create an application that addresses these challenges head-on. 
The 'Journaling App' is a comprehensive full-stack project that leverages a tech stack comprising React for the frontend, Auth0 for third-party authentication, Express for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas as the cloud database. 
It enables users to record voice notes seamlessly and utilizes OpenAI's advanced Whisper model for speech-to-text transcription.These voice notes would be converted to text, allowing you to read and edit them later at your convenience.

Currently, I am working on AI integration, to perform sentiment analysis on the text using the powerful ChatGPT API. This analysis would help you identify triggers, patterns, and fluctuations in your mood throughout the day.
